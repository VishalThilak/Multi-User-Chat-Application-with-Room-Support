# Multi-User-Chat-Application-with-Room-Support

This project is a chat application that allows multiple users to chat in real-time and create chat rooms. It builds on a previous assignment by adding persistent data storage using MongoDB. This ensures that chat rooms and messages are retained even after the server restarts.

## Features
- **Real-time Chat**: Users can join chat rooms and send messages in real-time.
- **Persistent Data**: Chat rooms and messages are stored in a MongoDB database, ensuring data persistence.
- **Infinite Scrolling**: Users can scroll up to load older messages dynamically.
- **REST API**: The server exposes REST endpoints for interacting with the database.


## Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed on your system.
- **MongoDB**: Install MongoDB Community Server from [mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com/).
- **MongoDB Node.js Driver**: Install the MongoDB driver using `npm install mongodb`.
